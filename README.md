# Child Process Pool Demo

This demo application creates a pool of workers for external processes and manages the asynchronous execution of queued processes on that pool of workers via lazy promises.

__Note:__ This code is a quick and dirty demo only and not intended to be considered as an optimized (or even remotely vetted) solution. It came from a discussion after a Node meetup and I wanted to put it to code as an example.

#### Instructions
Install dependencies: `npm install`  
Execute the demo: `npm start`
